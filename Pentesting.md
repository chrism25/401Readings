Pentesting

A pen test is a simulated cyber attack to look for exposed vulnerabilities, in web application security the findings of this test are used to augment the web application firewall (WAF) security policies and patch vulnerabilities.

### Penetration testing stages
* Planning and reconnaissance: In this stage the Penstester lays out the objectives and plan the testing methods to be used against the designated targets. In addition, gathers all possible information about the target, like domains, networks, mail servers to look for vulnerabilities.
* Scanning: The target is scanned using either Static or Dynamic analysis. In the static analysis the entire code of the application is scanned to estimate how it will behave while running (can be done in a single pass). The dynamic one, is more accurate since it provides a real time view into the application performance.
* Gaining Access: Web application attacks are performed to uncover vulnerabilities, once they are found the testers exploit them to understand how lethal they can be. Some of the vulnerabilities are backdoors and cross-site scripting; on the other hand some of the exploits can be stealing data and escalating privileges.
* Maintaining Access: At this point the goal is to create persistence in the system to maximize the intrusion. This simulates advanced persistent threats that can be in the system for months.
* Analysis: Once the test is concluded the results are compiled into a detailed report remarking exploited vulnerabilities, accessed sensitive data and undetected time of intrusion.  The report will help shape the WAF settings and other application security solutions to patch vulnerabilities and protect against possible attacks.
