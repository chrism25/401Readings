* The Center for Internet Securiity CIS have benchmarks of best pratices for securely configurating IT environments. There are more than 140 guidelines and experts around the world weigh on these benchmarks.
* CIS is also know for its 20 safeguarad and conteermeasures (CIS Controls) published that reduce and prevent cybersecurity attacks.
* There are 2 levels for these benchmarks. Level 1 are easy configurations to implement that donâ€™t affect the business much and Level 2 needs planning and organization in order to not disrupt the organization too much since these configurations are meant for high security environments.
* Additionally, these benchmarks divide into 7 categories:
> * Operating Systems: Security configurations for the core operating systems, also guidelines for internet browser configuration and local/remote access restrictions among others.
> * Server Software: Security configurations of server software, also guideline to configure Kubernetes PKI certificates and vNetworks policies to mention a few.
> * Cloud Provider: Security configurations for major clouds like AWS, also guidelines to configure identity and access management(IAM) and regulatory compliance safeguards for instance.
> * Mobile Device: Address mobile operating systems, additionally focusing on areas like  developer options and settings, browser settings and app permissions. 
> * Network devices: Security configuration for vendors concentrating on network devices and applicable hardware.
> * Desktop Software: Security configuration for most common desktop software apps like Microsoft Office, fixing on software blocking, email privacy and server settings among others.
> * Multifunction Print devices: Security configurations for multifunction printers, firmware updating, file sharing and more.
* Preconfigured hardened images are a secure feature that is cost effective, more secure than standard images significantly reducing the vulnerabilities. This feature works in most major cloud platforms and is offered by CSI.
* CSI additionally that being worldwide supported, complies with NIST PCI DSS, HIPAA and ISO/EIC 27200 cybersecurity frameworks.
* This is because of all the benchmarks that it offers like: Collected global expertise in cybersecurity, regular updates with guidelines for cybersecurity, compliance management consistency, adoption of cloud services and executing digital transformation strategies, improvement of operational efficiency and sustainability.

Definitely a good subject to know more of, since sometimes people ignore something as simple as hardening the systems which makes a big difference when talking about cybersecurity defense
