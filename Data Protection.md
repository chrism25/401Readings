# <p align="center"> Data Protection in Transit and at Rest center</p>

* Data in transit is data moving from network to network or to/from a local storage, this data has more exposure to being breached so it's imperative to protect it.
* On the other hand, data at rest is less exposed to risks since the place that stores it normally has a protection in place, however measures have to be placed to make sure actors can’t infiltrate and get into this data.
* A great way to protect this data is to encrypt it and when it is time to move it use an encrypted connection like SSL or TLS, even the storage drive can be encrypted.
* Other ways to implement protection to this data are:
> * Implementation of robust network security controls, firewalls and network access controls will secure the network used for the transmission.
> * The use of proactive security measures instead of reactive ones.
> * Data protection solutions should have policies that enable blocking or automatic encryption, user prompting, removable or transferred drives.
> * Creation of policies to systematically categorize and classify the organization’s data, so the respective measures can apply depending on the circumstances.
* Even though data in transit tends to be more vulnerable than data at rest, actors will focus not just on vulnerable data but also valuable, so they may ignore your data being transported to try to steal the juicy one hidden behind your firewall. This is the reason why a proactive approach is recommended and it should include classification and categorization data coupled with content, user and context aware security protocols.

* This is definitely a great topic to know a little more about since actors never rest on their continuous goal to breach your data.
