# <p align="center"> Cyber Risk Analysis
Risks are huge aspects in our lives and they need to be assessed carefully but quickly since they are present in all the areas. It is because of this reason that Risk Management is a crucial aspect that involves comprehensive understanding, analysis and mitigation of risk.
* Security and Risk Management is a big are but the main points are:
  * Understand, adhere to and promote professional ethics
  * Understand and apply security concepts
  * Evaluate and apply security governance principles
  * Determine compliance and other requirements
  * Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in a holistic context
  * Understand requirements for investigation types 
  * Develop, document, and implement security policy, standards, procedures and guidelines
  * Identify, analyze and prioritize Business Continuity requirements
  * Contribute to and enforce personnel security policies and procedures
  * Understand and apply risk management concepts
  * Understand and apply threat modeling concepts and methodologies
  * Apply Supply Chain Risk Management concepts
  * Establish and maintain a security awareness, education and training program
* The security model should involve having control in places to support the mission of the organizations and all the decisions must be based on the risk tolerance of the organization
* Additionally, having all domains centrally administered, implementing VPNs and radius servers provides a secure environment that helps bring a peace of mind.
* Because of the time frames, there are goals that vary on different layers. For example:
  * Operational Goals: Also known as daily goals that focus on productivity and are task oriented. These ensure the company’s functionality and may include patching computers, user support, antiviruses and maintenance of the network.
  * Tactical Goals: These are mid-term goals, may include computers and domains, firewalls and network segregation, workstation and resources integration.
  * Strategic Goal: These are long term goals that may include, migration of branches, VPNs and comprehensive security to the wireless environment.
* This technique is called planning horizon since not all desired changes are goals that can be implemented at once. However, it is better when these goals work together and support each other instead of a decentralized organization.

* The CIA triad is a security framework intended to guide policies within an organization.
* Confidentiality: To prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized parties, some key aspects are:
  * Social Engineering: For training and awareness to enforce policies, conduct vulnerability assessments and define the separation of duties.
  * Media Reuse: Proper sanitation strategies
  * Eavesdropping: To encrypt sensitive information and keep it off the network with restricted access.

* Integrity: To protect and detect sensitive information from being modified without authorization, some important areas are:
  *  Encryption using integrity-based algorithms
  * Prevention of malicious or intentional modifications

* Availability: To ensure all intended parties can have fast and reliable access to resources when needed, it is important to focus on:
  * Prevent single point of failure
  * comprehensive fault tolerance

* In order to Support the CIA triad it is important to:
  * Separate Duties: To prevent one person to have totalitarian power, prevent singleness focus, separation of duties to prevent collusion.
  * Mandatory Vacations: So a person doesn’t become the sole operator of a system, someone else should also be able to take cover these duties when needed.
  * Job Rotation: Cross training employees will help them understand different areas and how their work affects others, with the benefit of having them ready to cover that position if the situation arrives.
  * Least Privileges: Users should only have access to what their job requires.
  * Need to Know: Sensitive information should be only on a “need to know” basis.
  * Dual control: Task should require the control of more than one person.
* In order to manage risk one has to identify, examine, measure, mitigate or transfer risk, being the main goal to reduce its probability. 
* First the risk has to be assessed, identify the treats and their vulnerabilities. Then, analyzing the risk will put a monetary value to each risk event so the appropriate mitigation method can be applied. Finally, a constant evaluation should be in place to be ready for new emerging threats.
* In these steps it is important to be aware of the assets, vulnerabilities, threat, threat agent, exploits, risks and controls.
* It is also important to take into account, weak or non-existing antiviruses, disgruntled employees, poor physical security, weak access controls, lack of change management, no process for hardening systems, poorly trained users and lack of awareness.

The lifecycle for risk management is:
* Risk Assessment: Ongoing process to categorize and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats, periodically re-evaluation is needed.
  * System characterization
  * Threat identification
  * Vulnerability identification
  * Control analysis
  * Likelihood determination
  * Impact analysis
  * Risk determination
  * Control recommendation
  * Results documentation
* Risk Analysis: There can be a qualitative analysis which is subjective to describe the likelihood and severity of the threat, or it could be a qualitative analysis which requires calculations to determine the monetary value of each risk, this determines the cost/benefit responses.
  * AV: Asset value
  * EF: Exposure factor
  * ARO: Annual rate of occurrence
  * Single loss expectancy = AV * EF
  * Annual loss expectancy = SLE * ARO
  * Risk value = probability * impact (Probability is how likely it is for the threat to materialize and impact the extent of the damage)
* Mitigating Risk:
  * The only acceptable responses are to reduce or avoid the risk, transfer it and accept it or reject it.

* To achieve security governance, security blueprints have to be created so organizations can implement procedures to achieve the organization’s goal.
* Security needs to be directed and supported by top management, this top down approach prevents poor security management since most companies use a bottom-up approach in which the IT is in charge but the heads with the necessary funds are not involved. 
* Auditing, Data Security, SLA agreements, policies, roles and responsibilities are key factors in the management of a Security Program.
* Management should be responsible to enforce the organization's security policy, make decisions based on the risk, allocate the necessary resources, enforce, develop and support the organization policies.
