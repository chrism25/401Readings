# <p align="center">Strategic Policy Development
* Definitely a subject to understand since is an attestment to all the securities that are being put in place. Many of us don’t like the long documents or all the policies put in place but these are main rules that need to be clear and well documented for a good secure working environment. 
* SOC 2 is a very important framework for providers that store customer’s data like SaaS businesses. Since enterprises are held to higher standards, providers have to ensure control over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy. These are the 5 Trust Principles. 
* Nowadays SOC 1 focuses on financial reports, while SOC 2 focuses on Trust Services Criteria. 
> * Security: The main principle for auditing
> * Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
> * Availability: Systems or data will be available as agreed.
> * Integrity: Systems or data can’t be changed in an unauthorized manner.
> * Privacy: Protection of used, collected, retained, disclosed and disposed personal data.
* Common Criteria touches on every aspect of information security controls, Organization and management, Communications, risk management, monitoring of controls, logical and physical access control, system operations, change management.
* In order for companies to achieve SOC 2 compliance, they focus on systems in the scope, develop policies and procedures and implement security controls. These preparations normally take them from 6 months to a year and the type of audit can be I, at a single point in time or II, over the past 6 months.
* A company with SOC 2 compliance will provide peace of mind to their clients. A large company may survive a security incident, but for a young or small company this type of incident can mean the end. But more importantly this will build a strong security that will mitigate potential attacks, resulting in more business.
* It is obviously a tedious process but it is well worth it and the sooner the measures are implemented it is easier to escalate them and set a working environment focused on security. 
* The main process to be SOC 2 compliant is to set policies that meet security requirements, implement the procedures based on these policies and the documentation that proves the procedures are being followed. 
* Policies that should be follow are: Information Security, Access Control, Password, Change Management, Risk Assessment and Mitigation, Incident Response, Logging and Monitoring, vendor Management, Data Classification, Acceptable Use, Information Software and System Backup Policy, Business continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan.
* For the Common Criteria framework, there are 9 that are typically associated with SOC 2.
> * Control Environment: Ensure the company commitment to security and integrity, management trains accordingly and uses appropriate softwares.
> * Communication and Information: Creation of policies, procedures based on security, consistent and reliable secure communication, high quality policies and documentation that are easily accessible.
> * Risk Assessment: Analyze risks to achieve clear goals, assessment and documentation of current and potential risks.
> * Monitoring Activities: Constantly monitor and evaluate effectiveness and communicate deficiencies appropriately. 
> * Control Activities: Implements controls while mitigating risks, clear and transparent policies for expectations and procedures.
> * Logical and Physical Address: Physical protection of servers storing and encryption of it at all times. Limited access to only the right people and documentation of all these practices.
> * System Operations: Ensure business continuity, disaster recovery plan, and incident response. Documentation of working implementation.
> * Change Management: Clear and reliable control for how the system changes, any change should be tested before it happens and documented. 
> * Risk Mitigation: Well defined business processes and vendor management in order to mitigate and minimize risks. 
* Workflow is important in an organization but security shouldn’t be compromised, since changes may arise loopholes that could be exploited. A provider can facilitate a much easier management of these tasks so one can focus on running the business.
