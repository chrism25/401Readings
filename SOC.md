# <p align="center"> Security Operations Center

* It is always important to understand SOC when thinking about the company because it involves a big field that requires great attention and it is a smart investment. 
* SOC is the centralized location where a security team made up of highly skilled security analysts and engineers respond to cybersecurity incidents. This team oversees all systems to pinpoint potential security threats and follow specific processes in order to eradicate the breaches and plan how to prevent them.
* There are also Global Security Operations centers(GSOC) that deal with this issue but on a larger scale, coordinating the security around the world instead of having a team at each country, this provides a bigger picture and reduces overhead.
* The SOC provides some peace of mind for security threats, it is mandatory in some cases and companies are more open to do business with organizations that have a SOC.
> * Faster Responds: They are able to analyze the entire organization in real time and even prevent occurrences.
> * Protection of consumer and customer trust: Once consumers and customers see that the organization has a SOC the level of trust increases.
> * Minimize cost: Even though is an extra cost, the team is most likely to prevent breaches that can end disastrous lawsuits and are likely to make sure the company are using the most efficient and secure tools for the job.

* Whenever the SOC is not detecting threats, it is constantly gathering threat intelligence and running software and hardwares analysis to find weaknesses outside/inside the organization. One clear example is pentesting their own system to assess vulnerabilities, a good SOC provides:
> * 24/7 surveillance of network, hardware and software for breaches, threats and incident responses.
> * Proficiency on all the tools the organization uses, even 3rd party vendors, so the issue can be resolved quickly.
> * Troubleshooting, installation and updating of software applications.
> * Monitoring and managing intrusion prevention systems and firewalls.
> * Scanning and remediation of malware, antivirus and ransomware solutions.
> * Voice, email and video traffic management.
> * Patch management and whitelisting.
> * In depth analysis of security logs from numerous sources.
> * Documentation, analysis and investigation of security trends.
> * Inspection of security breaches so they can be prevented based on their root cause.
> * Enforcement of security policies and procedures.
> * Backup, storage and recovery.

* There is a hierarchy in most SOCs based on their experience
> * Lvl 1: The 1st line of defense, watch for alerts, determine their urgency and decide if it is necessary to move it up to lvl 2. Some may run reports and manage security tools.
> * Lvl 2: Better at finding the root cause, remediate the problem and fix any fallout. They also mark issues for additional investigation
> * Lvl 3: Made of proficient security analysts including forensic investigators and compliance auditors. They use advanced tools for threat detection, constantly searching for vulnerabilities so they can recommend improvements for the system.
> * Lvl 4: High level managers and chief officers with years of experience in charge to ensure compliance with organization, industry and government regulations. In addition to oversee all SOC team activities, hiring and training, and evaluate employees’ performance. They intervene during crises, serving as the link between the SOC and the rest of the organization. 

* Additionally exist the Network Operations Center(NOC) which makes sure the network performance and speed are at their best and the downtime to its minimum; their job is the same as the SOC but their target is the network speed and downtime. It is always recommended for SOC and NOC to work together since their goals are very alike and sometimes their duties overlap each other’s.

* There are 3 common types of SOC
* Internal SOC, a physical room with a full time staff based on premises. Virtual SOC, part time or contracted specialists working remotely, collaborating to resolve issues as needed. The work flow is based on the company needs. Outsourced SOC, most if not all functions are managed by a provider (MSSP) specialized in security analysis and response; the provider may handle the whole work or provide support to an internal SOC.
* In order to build and run a SOC there are some key elements to take into account.
* Develop a strategy, it needs to cover your security needs since it is an important investment.
> * What do you need to secure? A single on-premises network, or global? Cloud or hybrid? How many endpoints? Are you protecting highly confidential data or consumer information? What data is most valuable, and most likely to be targeted?
> * Will you have a SOC and NOC department or will they fuse into one? The answer will require different tools and personnel skills.
> * Do you need 24/7/365 availability from your SOC staff? This will affect staffing, cost and logistics.
> * Will the SOC be entirely in-house, or outsource some or all functions to a third-party vendor? Careful cost-benefit consideration is required to establish the trade-offs.

* Organization wide visibility, the SOC should have access to everything to make sure security doesn’t get compromised, this includes endpoints, systems controlled by third party vendors and encrypted data.
* Investing in the right tools and services, in order to deal with potential threats the team has to have the right automated tools so the job can be done efficiently. Some key tools are:
> * Security information and event management: SIEM is a security management system that provides complete oversight of all activities within the network. It collects, parses and categorizes machine data from a wide range of sources on the network in real time, so the SOC can take the appropriate response.
> * Endpoint protection systems: It is an endpoint security tool that checks on all endpoints when they access the network, since every endpoint is vulnerable to attack.
> * Firewall: It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic, automatically blocking traffic based on established security tools.
> * Automated application security: Automates the testing process across all software and provides the security team with real-time feedback about vulnerabilities.
> * Asset discovery system: This system checks on the active and inactive tools, devices and software being implemented on the network, in order to evaluate and address weaknesses and risks.
> * Data monitoring tool: It tracks and analyze data to ensure its security and integrity.
> * Governance, risk and compliance system: GRC system that ensures compliance with rules and regulations where and when you need to be.
> * Vulnerability scanners and penetration testing: Scan the network for vulnerabilities to detect weaknesses in it.
> * Log management system: Logs all messages coming from software, hardware and endpoint device running on the network.

* Hiring and Training the right staff: Hiring and investing in talented staff will prove rewarding for the business, this helps them become better workers and they are most likely to value the investment made on them. The field is big so continuous education is important, the staff should know about LINUX, UNIX, SIEM, network security, firewalls, information assurance, and security engineering and architecture. Also, the top tier specialist should perform well on:
> * Ethical hacking: A member should actively be trying to hack the system to uncover the present vulnerabilities.
> * Cyber forensics: Analysts have to investigate issues and apply analysis techniques to understand and preserve evidence from the investigations. This evidence may play a vital role if a legal case happens to occur.
> * Reverse engineering: Deconstructing a software and rebuilding it, helps to analyze its core so one can understand its weakness and take preventive measures.
> * Intrusion prevention system expertise: The team needs to know how to properly implement the tools, so the network traffic can efficiently be monitored for threats.

* One really helpful tool that was mentioned before was SIEM, since it can collect data from numerous resources making it easier to inspect for suspicious activity. Based on this info the team can respond to internal and external attacks, simplify threat management, minimize risk and gain organization-wide visibility and security intelligence.
* Since the amount of data could be overwhelming and something may slip through the cracks, SIEM can parse through all this data in no time and stop it automatically. Moreover, automation can be set with SIEM to minimize false alerts and the reports could benefit the forensic team and help with compliance. 
* This is only one of the many tools that can benefit the organization, so it can just focus on keep growing, so when thinking about the organization it is always to question, what are the security needs? and how can they be met effectively and efficiently?
