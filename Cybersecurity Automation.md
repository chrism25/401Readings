# <p align="center"> Cybersecurity Automation

Definitely a great topic to know more of and consider, since it has a great impact on security breaches and is one more step into the future of cybersecurity
* Automation is a great solution to repetitive mundane tasks. By automating these tasks, time will be saved, leaving room to focus on more important problems like engineering and architecture, remediation activities, automation development  and engineering among tohers, which can ultimately lead to innovation and maximize productivity. 
* When referring to new automation practices, it is always important to implement the following tools to gather intelligence and take an automated action or prompt a team member to take a further action.
  * Security automation and orchestration(SOAR) products that arrange activities between security tools and perform automated activities in response to identified threats.
  * Robotic process automation(RPA) tools that allow processes to be automated.
  * Custom developed software and code that automates processes and performs tasks.

* As technology advances, organizations look for ways to improve their ecosystem to maximize efficiency and save on costs. These organizations look to digitally transform their activities, which makes the enterprise more complex and the cybersecurity team needs to be ready to handle new risks.
*  Since many risks can arise into a more complex enterprise, manually looking for vulnerabilities should be just a complement of an automated activity. A well designed program is less likely to miss things and then an individual can make sure nothing slipped through the cracks.
* If an attack happens to arise a response team has to act immediately. However that is not always the case, some factors may affect the time response. Because of reasons like this, automated incident response capabilities are key, since not even a minute is wasted and the damage can be contained or mitigated.
* When implementing automation into an organization it is always important to take into account:
  * Embed development capabilities in the cybersecurity area, so developers report directly to cyber leaders.
  * Cybersecurity and organizational development teams should work together to implement more efficient innovations.
  * It is wise to have a team for tactical development work and another for organizational development capabilities.

* Here are some examples in which automating incident responses are very useful.
  * If an actor gets to interact with someone in the network, the fastest response would be for the firewall to block the actor’s IP, however firewalls don’t tend to be connected to other security tools and are not frequently updated, which may even require some permissions. If we apply an automated response like USM, the firewall will be updated swiftly, blocking the malicious IP as soon as it detects it with its integrated threat intelligence. 
  *  If malware breaches into one of the systems, the response team has to contain and investigate the malware intrusion. In this case, a tool like USM can fetch additional forensic data, disable networking on an infected system, run vulnerability scans and isolate at risk systems until a decision to address them is taken.
  *  When a system has been breached and contained, in order to understand the scope of the damage and how it may have affected the organization the systems and its logs need to be reviewed and other data analyzed. In this case USM aggregates events and logs from across all systems and networks, this information can be filtered so one can get to the answer quickly; in the same manner, specific systems can be looked up.
  * It is normal that from time to time new malware emerges and one has to be aware of them to prevent the system from getting infected or even make sure it hasn't breached the system already. In this scenario, a product that builds actionable threat intelligence updates into the security plan can assure detection of new threats without having to do the heavy lifting. 

* These are only a few cases in which automated incident response can minimize and even eliminate threats, something that obviously is vital since every minute counts when an attack is being deployed. USM Anywhere is only one of the SaaS providers that can bring solutions like this. These kinds of providers normally let you provide all these great futures from one place combining them with your existing securities.
