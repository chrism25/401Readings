# <p align="center"> Data Loss Prevention and Data Classification

* DLP ensures that no sensitive data is lost, misused or accessed by unauthorized users. This software classifies data and recognizes policy violations set by organizations. These violations are commonly driven by regulatory compliance such as GDPR, PCI-DSS or HIPAA. 
* The violations trigger pre-determined protective actions to prevent end users from sharing data that might endanger the organization.
* DLP filters data streams on corporate networks, monitors and controls end point activities, and monitors data in the cloud to protect data in motion, at rest and in use.
* The reports created from DLP can be used to meet compliance, auditing requirements, identify weak areas and anomalies for incident response and forensics purposes.
* Organizations normally benefit from DLP for 3 main features:
	* Personal Information Protection/Compliance: If the organization stores PII, PHI or PCI, then HIPAA and GDPR impose regulations to comply in order to protect the customers data. The reporting capabilities provide details needed for compliance audits.
	* IP Protection: Digital Guardian can classify intellectual property to prevent its exfiltration when policies are properly set.
	* Data Visibility: It allows the user to see and track data on endpoints, network and cloud.

* Since the pandemic most businesses and resources have gone online which increase the number of targets and chances for breaches that can cost large amounts of money. Organizations tend to adopt DLP services because of:
	* Growth of CISO Role: CEOs want a clear understanding of the plan to prevent data leaks. Chief Information Security Officers are tasked with this duty and DLP provides them with the capabilities to provide the CEO with frequent updates.
	* Evolving Compliance Mandates: Organizations have to be prepared to adapt to constantly changing data protection regulations. DLP provides flexibility to evolve with these changing global regulations.
	* More places to protect the data: Nowadays everybody uses the cloud, there are supply chains and other services that are out of one’s control. DLP gives the user visibility of events around the data before it leaves the organization, so it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.
	* Data Breaches: There are several actors constantly targeting sensitive data for a variety of reasons, from financial gain to espionage. DLP helps prevent these frequent attacks.
	* Stolen Data Value: Most sensitive data has a high value on the dark web so actors are constantly looking for data to sell.
	* Sensitive Data has expanded: Nowadays, intangible assets like pricing models and business methodologies have a high value too. In 2018 they hit a record of $21 trillion.
	* Security Talent Shortage: There is a shortage of security talent as demands grow. DLP acts as an extension of your team to fill the gap.

### Best practices for DLP
* The first step is to determine the data protection objective. Is it compliance, protect intellectual property, gain visibility? This way the most adequate DLP architecture deployment can be taken, Endpoint DLP, Network DLP, Discovery or Cloud.
* Evaluate what the DLP offers:
	* Types of Arquitectures
	* OS support with feature parity
	* Deployment options and managed services
	* Protection against Internal/external threats
	* Methods for inspection and classification
	* Focus on structured or unstructured data
	* Enforce data movements based on policies, events or users
	* Current and likely to come compliance regulations
	* Does it need staff to be managed?
* Define roles and responsibilities of the staff involved with the DLP clearly. A role based rights and duties will provide checks and balances
* Begin with a clearly defined approach and set objectives that can be measured.
* Consult with the heads of different departments when developing DLP policies since these will affect the whole organization.
* Determine and share the metrics of the DLP program with the heads departments to show business value and review the areas of improvement.
* Don’t just rely on DLP to be autonomous, this is a program that needs to be continuously worked on in order to achieve lasting success.

* Data protection requires everyone to follow security standards. Once the staff is trained they feel responsible and are aware of the risks, this will provoke employees to be careful when handling data. In addition, setting up alarms to flag instances with suspicious activities will minimize inside threats. 
* It is also important to encrypt data in the rightway, when done so correctly an encryption is almost unbreakable. 
* There are cloud based data protection platforms like Digital Guardian that give a 360⁰ perspective on data movement, real time analytics prioritizing threats efficiently and flexible controls that are automated.
