# <p align="center"> Exploitation with Metasploit

* Metasploit is an essential framework that aims to help users find vulnerabilities in their targets so they can be fixed and raise awareness.
* This command line carries many tools that pentesters can utilize and comes preinstalled on kali. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with reconnaissance tools like Nmap, Windows patch enumeration and Nessus among others.
* It also contains post exploitation tools to pass the hash, packet sniffing, keyloggers, privilege escalation and back door creation among others.
* It has been around for many years and has now more than 1500 exploits and 500 payloads that will keep increasing.
* It is not unusual to see Metasploit involved in zero day discoveries, since it has become very popular.
* There are many ways to learn how to use it around the web, and it can be obtained from different places like its website and Github. However, the best way to obtain it and learn to use it is to get a Kali machine and a vulnerable target so you can start practicing with it.
* Metasploit also comes in different flavors like Metasploit Community Edition, a web based user interface and Metasploit Pro.
