### Code of Ethics
* There is a code of conduct design to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration. 
* This code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur and as a basis for ethical decision-making, since the actions of computing professionals may shape the world. Some principles that these professionals must have are:
	* Contribute to society and to human well being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
	* Avoid harm
	* Be Honest and Trustworthy, maintain integrity and independence in your professional judgment.

	* Be fair and take action not to discriminate
	* Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works and computing artifacts.
	* Respect privacy
	* Honor confidentiality

* Also, have clear their responsibilities:
	* Strive to achieve high quality in both the process and products of professional work.
	* Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct and ethical practice.
	* Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
	* Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
	* Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
	* Perform work only in areas of competence
	* Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies and their consequences.
* Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
* Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

* Leaders in this area need to abide by the following principles:
	* Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
	* Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
	* Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
	* Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
	* Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
	* Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.
	* Ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
	* Subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

* Compliance with the code
	* Uphold, promote and respect the principles of the Code.

### Ethics in the Workplace
* We all want to be team players in our work and tackle those assignments in the best possible way to keep to the next one. However, it is important to realize how our work will impact the life of the people we promise will be the priority. Always take a minute to see the end goal, the big picture and not just blindly do the assignment.
* For example, Google employees presented a letter to their executives seeking transparency and details about the projects they work on, since these were affecting millions of people and only a small group knew about it. In a similar case engineers resigned from a project for the pentagon because they thought it was an unethical use of AI, which led to the termination of the contract and executives promising they would never use AI technology to harm others.
*  Sadly companies nowadays are more concerned about making revenues more profitable for stakeholders and technologies are pushed and encouraged even if they harm the population as long as they produce revenue. Outsourcing has become an standard for many companies, 

### Ethics in Technology
* It is important to thoroughly think about all possible scenarios when developing new technologies. A clear example that is beneficial in many ways are self driving cars, these will minimize traffic, reduce accidents and many more; but what will happen in a case when an accident can’t be avoided? Will the car prioritize the well being or even life of its driver even above the well being of children is a school bus?
* Sadly, several ethical questions are being made at every turn. Developers have to find a way to instruct the car to make the best decision for every eventuality.  

### Company Principles
* It is important to wonder about how technology can aid humanity but it is also as important to think about how it can harm it or even destroy it, because it is highly likely that someone is working in a way to use technology in a harmful way and one should be prepared.
* Ethical OS toolkit presents a check of 8 risk zones to identify emerging areas of risk and most critical social harm to consider, 14 scenarios to start conversations about long term impacts of tech you’re building today and 7 future proofing strategies to help take ethical action today.

* In order to safeguard public good, more tools like this and movement should be implemented. Technology nowadays can have a huge impact on our lives and more moral questions have to be asked in order to protect this future.
* For example, should owners of a developed technology sell their products to companies in the business of weapons for mass destruction?

---------------------

None of the examples mentioned here aim to depict a bad picture of products or companies but to ignite a spark in the mind of the population and especially professionals in these fields. We can’t deny any longer that morals and values are needed now more than ever since new life changing technologies are appearing more often and we need to critically think about their impact in society.
