# <p align="center"> PowerShell Empire Framework

* The Empire project is a great tool that shows post-exploitation approaches that actors can achieve, it's mainly to raise awareness and see how actors might behave.
* Sadly this project has been discontinued, since there are newer projects and the developers say the project has achieved his goal, Powershell’s post exploitation capabilities.
* Empire has a modular architecture and it is lightweight, this combined with the encrypter communication that holds with the command control server, make it a great tool. To this already great tool many exploits were added, like a python agent and powershell.exe was not needed on the infected host as well.
* The goal of this project was educational, so white hackers could learn more about the process. However many actors used this tool to their advantage, for example “Hades” in the Olympic Destroyer campaign (2018 South Korea), FIN7 used it a lot, the Cobalt Strike threat emulation software was just one of them.
* Additionally many botnets used it for network exploitation and lateral movement, even on high profile ransomware attacks.
* These are just some of the many incidents that took advantage of Empire, maybe this is one of the reasons why the project is not going to be maintained anymore. However there are many projects like this that thankfully haven’t been exploited as much. Apfell, Covenant, Silver and Faction are some of these.
