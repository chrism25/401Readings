# <p align="center"> Forensic Investigation with Autopsy

* Computer Forensics specializes in investigating Data breaches, security issues and other cyber crimes. Many specialists in this area work for law enforcement agencies and focus on recovering digital evidence to resolve cyber crime and deal with network breaches that already happened to learn from them and prepare for future threats.
* This area works very well with cybersecurity since both focus on keeping criminals away. Cybersecurity focuses on prevention while Computer Forensics reacts to actors getting in.
*  Nowadays cybercrime is over the top, every 39 seconds there is a cyber attack and every day 300,000 new malware programs are created. That is why cyber forensics is so important, it helps companies recover and come back stronger.
* A degree in Computer Science or Cybersecurity can help guide you on either of these paths and these are some of the jobs for both areas.

Digital Forensics
	* Information Security Crime Investigator: Find evidence on devices to aid lawyers and law enforcements to solve investigations.
* Computer Forensics Engineer: Evaluates software and architecture to understand what happened after an attack.
	* Digital Forensics: Analyzes data and software to look for evidence and understand what happened in a breach. Also known as Computer Forensic or Cyber Forensic.
	* Computer Forensic Specialist: An entry level position that focuses on scans and research of an attack.
	* Computer Forensic Analyst: Analyzes data and information to produce evidence and understanding of a breach. Also known as Computer Forensics Investigator o Examiner.
	* Computer Forensic Technician: Detailed and technical work of the forensics systems. For example data recovery, pulling specific data as evidence, logging information about breaches.

* When conducting an investigation about a breach there are many responsibilities and duties that a Cyber Forensic job requires
Responsibilities
* Readiness: Investigations may arise at any time, therefore equipment should always be ready and experts need to be well trained, understand legal ramifications and plan ahead for technical and non-technical issues.
	* Evaluation: Roles and resources are assigned, facts and details need to acquire, and risks should be assessed.
	* Collection: tools, techniques, interviews and hard drives are some of the ways to collect the information needed for further investigation.
	* Analysis: All previous data is analyzed, documented and recorded. This data needs to be accurate, unbiased and meet deadlines.
	* Presentation: Findings are presented and strategies are offered in order to prevent future breaches. Courts also need to be provided with this information.
	* Review: The team reviews how the case was handled to evaluate performance and end product for future improvement.

Duties
